# Toggle Emulate 3 Button Mouse

This add on provides a hotkey to quickly toggle the Emulate 3 Button Mouse preference.

For Blender users that have Emulate 3 Button Mouse enabled, there is no ability to edit properties of multiple selected objects because the `Alt` key taken over by the emulator. `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + M` toggles this preference, releasing the `Alt` key so it may be used for multiselection property editing without having to open preferences every time.

### Why doesn't the add on simply remap the `Alt` key for multiselection property editing?

Blender reserves the `Alt` key for this function :(

## Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dub/toggle-emulate-3-button-mouse/releases/tag/v1.0).
2. In Blender, open Preference > Add ons > Install from disk
3. Enable the add on by checking its checkbox in the add on list

## Usage

- Hit `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + M` (`Shift + Ctrl + Option + M` on Mac) when you want to toggle the emulator.
- Change the keymap in the add on preference panel
